- Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
- Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorised logins, brute-force attacks or privilege escalations
- Visualising complex data and events into neat and trendy graphs
- Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies
